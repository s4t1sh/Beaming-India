        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          During the COVID-19 pandemic, online learning has become commonplace
          and, quite often, the only possible way to improve the expertise of
          company’s employees. However, this learning format has a number of
          disadvantages, the main one of which is lower rates of student
          engagement
          <span style="color: var(--primary-color)"
            >(about 72 percent note a decrease in this indicator compared to
            offline learning)</span
          >. In this regard, enterprises implementing solutions for EdTech
          market have to resort to specific methods to destroy this trend.
          Below, we will share our insights about increasing engagement in
          online learning.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">What Is Learner Engagement?</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          <span style="color: var(--primary-color); font-weight: bold"
            >So, what is learner engagement?</span
          >
          In a nutshell, it is determined, first of all, by the quality and
          quantity of knowledge acquired over a certain training course.
          Secondarily, it refers to the level of interaction between students,
          as well as between students and teachers (if their participation is
          implied in the specific training course).<br />
          To reach high levels of engagement, there are a number of EdTech
          development solutions aimed at keeping students'attention and focusing
          on tasks, as well as maintaining their mutual assistance at a high
          level. In the followingparagraphs, we will talk about what these
          solutions are and what aspects of engagement they affect.
        </p>

        <img
          src="assets/images/insights/insights2.png"
          alt=""
          class="mt-12 rounded-lg"
        />

        <p class="title mt-12">Committing to Engagement</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Ensuring online learning engagement and commitment is a culture that
          focuses on creating inherently engaging learning models that rely on
          two-way communication, superior user experience and design, motivation
          of students to progress through the course, and opportunities for
          socialization. Taken together, these aspects help to achieve learning
          results that are no worse than those that could be obtained by
          practicing alternative, offline approaches with the best teachers.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Another challenge accompanying the introduction of online learning is
          the seemingly great need to track intermediate indicators of student
          performance. However, in practice, this does not work in favor of
          companies that use this method. Instead of continuous monitoring, it
          is much better to be guided by the formation of precise, achievable
          goals for students and indicating the benefits from them. Local
          incentives for this can be virtual achievements, such as points,
          moving to a new level, and other elements that we are used to facing
          in video games.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          ELast but not least, constant interaction with students and adaptation
          to their individual needs is important. This is the only way they can
          truly experience the benefits of online learning that their offline
          alternative lacks.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">Communication</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Effectively involving students in the online learning process begins
          with using their usual communication channels. That’s why you should
          start by considering digital tools your company already uses for this
          – perhaps it’s email or instant messengers like Slack or Telegram. The
          best solution would be to integrate your online learning platform with
          these products so that the entry barrier for employees is not too
          high.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Another benefit of using traditional communication channels is that
          you can use them to “promote” your course. We're not talking about
          traditional marketing here, although you'll probably find some of its
          methods useful. In general, your global task is to convey the value of
          this training in order to initially create high motivation among
          employees.
        </p>

        <img
          src="assets/images/insights/insights3.png"
          alt=""
          class="mt-12 rounded-lg"
        />
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          In this regard, you have to clearly outline the benefits they will
          receive upon successful completion of the course. In the context of a
          specific organization, this may be career growth opportunities,
          development in the horizontal labor hierarchy of the company (this
          will be relevant for highly specialized personnel who want to
          completely change their area of competence), as well as a presentation
          of cases of employees who have undergone training and subsequently
          achieved outstanding results in their area of expertise.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">Course Design</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          By course design, we mean, first of all, its structure. In particular,
          this structure should be divided into topics that could be covered in
          short time periods (up to several weeks). Without such a partition,
          you risk making your course very difficult to master. At the same
          time, the completion of each new topic is usually accompanied by
          testing, although it is not mandatory.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          It is also important to understand for which topics it makes sense to
          develop webinars, and which of them should be presented in other
          formats – for example, in the form of guides, sets of rules,
          role-played training models, AI-driven simulators (it’s one of the
          greatest EdTech trends), group lessons, etc. At the same time, it is
          important to consider the initial level of your employees in order to
          ensure that the format you chose to cover a specific topic was the
          most accessible to them. In some cases, it is permissible to invite
          students to independently choose the most convenient format for
          presenting educational materials, but such flexibility is
          resource-intensive from the point of view of implementation.
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Overall, your course should combine all three components of effective
          learning: learning tasks, resources and supports, and their
          interactions with each other. However, what methods you choose to
          implement these components will depend both on the level of your
          students and on your business area as a whole.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">User Experience</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          We have already mentioned above the importance of user experience in
          the online learning process. In particular, you will have to pay
          special attention to the user experience, namely, in its
          intuitiveness. In general, your main motivation should be to eliminate
          additional barriers to learning associated with the complexity of the
          software solution within which it will take place.
        </p>

        <img
          src="assets/images/insights/insights4.png"
          alt=""
          class="mt-12 rounded-lg"
        />
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Gamification plays a significant role in ensuring this intuitiveness –
          it lies in the implementation of game principles and mechanics, for
          example, task systems, rewards, and symbols of progress, such as
          points and achievements. <br />
          Also, an important place in this is occupied by the mobility of
          learning – that is, the availability of your
          <span class="underline">LMS with gamification</span> and its
          functionality through mobile devices. This will allow your students to
          not be tied to a place and time to go through the next topic or pass
          the exam. The key to receiving this accessibility is to develop a
          responsive design that will ensure that your platform is compatible
          with any user device.
        </p>
        <p class="title mt-12">Motivation</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Ensuring that students are motivated throughout the course is an
          ongoing process that should involve more than just providing elements
          to “spark” their interest to move forward (for example, through the
          aforementioned gamification, creative design approaches, and
          highlighting the benefits accrued upon successful completion of the
          course).
        </p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          The fact is that the greatest demotivator for students is still their
          personal failure, which can be provoked by external factors – poor
          health, fatigue, family problems, etc. In this case, you will have to
          go beyond standard communication with your students by providing them
          with a free feedback form, where you can find out their individual
          reasons for poor performance and, perhaps, offer options for
          overcoming them outside the platform (if possible).

          Although eLearning has forced many organizations to transform their
          time-tested approaches to employee training, socialization remains
          fundamental to the success of this process. Indeed, the isolation of
          your students—both from each other and from their teachers—can be a
          significant barrier to their engagement training.

        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          In this section, we delve deeper into using data and analytics to
          enhance engagement in online learning, continuing the theme initiated
          in our partners' article at Corpsoft.io. Our analysis complements and
          expands upon their research presented in 'Enhancing EdTech Solutions

        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          To implement online training for your employees as quickly as
          possible, you can use customized learning management systems or LMSes
          (solutions for knowledge delivery, its assessment, and student
          management) as a base of your online learning platform. The main types
          of LMSes are considered below.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">Cloud Learning Management Systems</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          A cloud LMS is a solution that embodies all the benefits of the cloud:
          comprehensive accessibility (via browser), scalable storage, and
          customizable access rights. Users can interact with such systems from
          anywhere in the world where there is an Internet connection. In
          general, such systems are a great choice for EdTech professionals due
          to the fact that they provide simple interaction between companies and
          e-learning software developers. As for excellent examples of such
          systems, we can highlight Blocksi, which allows teachers to set up and
          manage courses quickly and easily.
        </p>

        <p class="title mt-12">Open-Source Learning Management Systems</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Open source LMSs are free and can be customized to suit the needs of
          the specific organizations that want to adopt them. Such LMSes are
          perfect for creating online learning platforms that require unique
          educational approaches. A successful example of open source systems is
          Moodle, which has useful features, such as creating course plugins or
          scalability up to millions of users.
        </p>
        <p class="title mt-12">Corporate Learning Management Systems</p>
        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          Such systems are used to train and improve the skills of employees
          within companies where it is necessary to monitor employees’
          productivity, check their compliance with requirements, and develop
          their skills. The big advantage of such systems is their easy
          integration with existing software solutions within a single IT
          infrastructure. A particular example of such systems is the LMS from
          the Corpsoft.io team, which developed a corporate solution for the
          MIDFIX company.

        <p class="paragraph mt-6">
          If you want to maximize the results of your online learner engagement
          strategy within your company, you will need to pay special attention
          to the design of the user interface, the structure of your course,
          communication between students and teachers, and their motivation.
          Since all of these aspects are resource-intensive to implement,
          developing such a solution from scratch can take up a lot of your
          time. On the other hand, you can simplify this process by using
          customizable LMS systems.
